excerpt: >
  Call of Duty 2 uses two rendering backends, DirectX7 and DirectX9.
  Usually Dx7 is used ingame for better performance.
  However you can enable Dx9 and get much better visuals,
  including dynamic lighning, shadows and simple reflections.
  This shows you how to modify the asset and shader-pipeline,
  set up the materials and change the HLSL to get awesome looking shaders ingame.
  From different weapon-skins, animated skies, vertex displacements
  or even toon-shader - it is possible to have CoD2 looking almost as good as
  recent games (if you have enough time to implement it for a game released in 2005)

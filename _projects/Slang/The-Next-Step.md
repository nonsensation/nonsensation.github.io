description: >
  The next evolutionary step in programming - an atempt
---

## History and Evolution

- Paper Cards
- Assembly like
- C like
- C++ like
- Frameworks Java
- Environments C#/.NET
- Attempts at visual/node based programming

## What is Missing?

 - describing intention with either too fine granularity
 - or too much abstraction
 - no real expression for planned behaviour
 - bugs hard to spot
 - multithreading hard to reason about
 - limited programming language/tooling

## The Next Step

- define basic blocks
- express intent
- merge into program

## Outline

- implement Slang (on top of C#/.NET)

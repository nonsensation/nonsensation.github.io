# Building websites

## Github Pages

In the end, there are two different types of websites:
- one for your account (or organization) and
- one for each project.


## Jekyll

### Download & Setup

### Your personal Website


## Gotchas

- Always double-check your filenames! Locally, while developing you can reference for example images like this: *assets/img/my-picture.png* when the filename of the image is really *my-picture.PNG*.  
Github-Pages will redirect you to a 404 page - as the filename is case sensitive!
- Folders from the jekyll-theme will be used and you can overwrite them in your own theme - except for the *_data* folder! You **must** copy this folder from the theme you are using (and its contents, line a *navigation.yml*) to your own theme!

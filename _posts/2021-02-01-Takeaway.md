## Takeaway - Delivery Driver

### Job Application

### First Day

I started at lunchtime and had 4 orders close to each other, within 2km down to only 400 meters. They were finished within 90 minutes. They the app said 'Wait here..' so I did - 30 minutes. And it was a mistake. When you do not move, you get cold fairly quick and you stay this way, the remaining shift will not be pleasent. So I went back into the city center in hope of getting a last order for the shift and I did. At the exact same location I've been waiting before, a few kilometers outside. But at least I was moving again.
In total I did 5 orders in a 3 hour shift, I expected to get around 2 per hour, if I am lucky maybe 3 or even 4.

My contract says 12 hours per week, I calculate with 15 hours at least. So I can make in 1 month (4 weeks) times 15 hours and 2 orders on average each hour:
$$4 * 15 * 2 = 120$$ orders each month. 
There is a bonus system for each delivery, if you pass 100 a month, you get 0.25€, for 150 you get 1.00€ and over 200 it is 2.00€.
With 120 orders average, I get 20 times the 0.25€ boni, or 5€ a month.
So this system is more appealing for more workhours.
